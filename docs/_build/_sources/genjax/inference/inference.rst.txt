Inference
=========

This section provides an overview of several inference methods (and their implementation) in GenJAX.

It also contains a tutorial note on common idioms for expressing inference algorithms, utilizing JAX functionality (like :code:`jax.vmap` and :code:`jax.jit`) - and "best practices" for exposing good jittable inference.
