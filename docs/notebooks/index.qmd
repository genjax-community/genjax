title: "Modeling and inference notebooks"
date: "December 1, 2022"

This is a notebook repository for pedagogical tutorials on usage of [Gen](https://www.gen.dev/), with a focus on the [GenJAX](https://github.com/probcomp/genjax) implementation.

Here, you'll find notebooks which span knowledge levels from beginner to advanced (in probabilistic programming). These notebooks are built and executed with the current version of `genjax`, so they are kept up to date with the repo.
