title: "Probabilistic programming with GenJAX"
date: "December 1, 2022"
abstract: "This is a notebook repository for tutorials on usage of [Gen](https://www.gen.dev/) for probabilistic programming, with a focus on the [GenJAX](https://github.com/probcomp/genjax) implementation. For [Gen.jl](https://github.com/probcomp/Gen.jl) notebook tutorials, [see the tutorial page on the Gen website](https://www.gen.dev/tutorials/). The notebooks provide pedagogical examples of the usage of Gen for modeling and inference, as well as describe Gen's multi-paradigmatic design philosophy for probabilistic programming. The notebooks are built and executed with the current version of `genjax`, so they are kept up to date with the repo."
