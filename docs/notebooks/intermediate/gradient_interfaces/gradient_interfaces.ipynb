    "The generative function interface exposes functionality which allows usage of generative functions for differentiable programming. These interfaces are designed to work seamlessly with `jax.grad` - allowing (even higher-order) gradient computations which are useful for inference algorithms which require gradients and gradient estimators. In this notebook, we'll describe some of these interfaces - as well as their (current, but not forever) limitations. We'll walk through an implementation of MAP estimation, as well as the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) using these interfaces."
