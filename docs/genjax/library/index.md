# Library reference

This is the API documentation for modules which are exposed publicly from `genjax`. The `genjax` package consists of several modules, many of which rely on functionality from the `genjax.core` module, and build upon datatypes and generative datatypes which are documented there.

* [Core](core/index.md)
* [Generative function languages](generative_functions/index.md)
* [Inference](inference/index.md)
* [Differentiable programming](diff_prog/index.md)
