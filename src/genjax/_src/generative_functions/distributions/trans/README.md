# GenJAX Distribution DSL

This module supports a distribution DSL similar to [Gen.jl][gen_dist].

A lot of the code here comes from [Oryx][oryx]. Ideally, I'd like to rely on Oryx to provide this functionality in the future - but I have no insight into the development model or pace of Oryx, so I've just forked a bunch of code - and kept the appropriate copyright attributions.
