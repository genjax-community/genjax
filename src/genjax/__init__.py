[`genjax`](https://github.com/probcomp/genjax) is a high-performance
probabilistic programming library built by combining the conceptual framework for modeling and inference from [Gen](https://www.mct.dev/assets/mct-thesis.pdf) with high-performance numerical compilation from [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). 

> In several ways, these two systems are a natural pair - JAX provides flexibility to construct composable function transformations as interpreters, and Gen provides a rich set of modeling and inference ideas grounded in  functional representations of generative processes.

## High-level

- Generative functions (models) are represented as pure functions from `(PRNGKey, *args)` to `(PRNGKey, retval)`.
- Exposes [the generative function interface](https://www.gen.dev/stable/ref/gfi/) as staged effect handlers built on top of `jax`.

  | Interface     | Semantics (informal)                                                                                |
  | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `simulate`    | Sample from normalized measure over choice maps                                                     |
  | `importance`  | Importance sample from conditioned measure, and compute an importance weight                        |
  | `diff`        | Given a new set of arguments and choice map, compute an importance weight diff and new return value |
  | `update`      | Given a new set of arguments and choice map, compute an updated trace                               |
  | `arg_grad`    | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to arguments                                |
  | `choice_grad` | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to values inside choice map                 |

- Supports usage of any computations acceptable by JAX (tbd) within generative function programs.
