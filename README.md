A concise encoding of Gen using zero-cost effect handling/tracing built on top of `jax`.

- Presents a modeling language based on the space of pure Python functions acceptable by `jax`: models are pure functions from `(PRNGKey, *args)` to `(PRNGKey, retval)`.
- Exposes [the generative function interface](https://www.gen.dev/stable/ref/gfi/) as staged effect handlers built on top of `jax`. (Roughly -- see documentation for exact signatures/return types):

  | Interface     | Semantics (informal)                                                                |
  | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `simulate`    | Sample from normalized measure over choice maps                                     |
  | `generate`    | Sample from conditioned measure, and compute an importance weight                   |
  | `arg_grad`    | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to arguments                |
  | `choice_grad` | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to values of random choices |

- Should support usage of any computations acceptable by JAX (tbd) within generative function programs.

## Building + tour

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, and [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) to automate testing/linting/building.

Make sure these are installed and on path with a Python environment `^3.10.0`. Running `nox` will evaluate the full test/linting/build suite.

```
# Install dependencies, and run the tour example!
poetry install
poetry run python examples/tour.py
```

## Implementation strategy

The implementation strategy is based on: [Handling effects with JAX](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HGs59anVC2AOsmt7C4v8yD6v8gZSJGm6#scrollTo=OHUTBFIiHJu3) extended to support dynamically specified handlers. As in the original, handlers are staged out (zero-cost, not dynamically dispatched) by the compositional tracing provided by `jax`.

This implementation also takes inspiration from [Zero-cost Effect Handlers by Staging](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/publications/schuster19zero.pdf) - sans automatic insertion of staging annotations. The inference interfaces exposed handle lifting/splicing/jitting internally (manually).
