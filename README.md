[![Build Status](https://github.com/probcomp/genjax/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/probcomp/genjax/actions)

- Generative functions (models) are represented as pure functions from `(PRNGKey, *args)` to `(PRNGKey, retval)`.
- Exposes [the generative function interface](https://www.gen.dev/stable/ref/gfi/) as staged effect handlers built on top of `jax`.

  | Interface     | Semantics (informal)                                                                |
  | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `simulate`    | Sample from normalized measure over choice maps                                     |
  | `importance`  | Importance sample from conditioned measure, and compute an importance weight        |
  | `update`      | Given a new set of arguments and choice map, compute an updated trace               |
  | `arg_grad`    | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to arguments                |
  | `choice_grad` | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to values inside choice map |

- Supports usage of any computations acceptable by JAX (tbd) within generative function programs.

## Building + tour

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, and [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) to automate testing/linting/building.

Make sure these are installed and on path with a Python environment `^3.10.0`. Running `nox` will evaluate the full test/linting/build suite.

```
# Install dependencies, and run the tour example!
poetry install
poetry run python examples/tour.py
```
