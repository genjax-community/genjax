## ðŸ”Ž What is it?

Gen is a multi-paradigm (generative, differentiable, incremental) language for probabilistic programming focused on [**generative functions**: computational objects which represent probability measures over structured sample spaces](https://probcomp.github.io/genjax/notebooks/introduction/intro_to_genjax/intro_to_genjax.html#what-is-a-generative-function). 

GenJAX is an implementation of Gen on top of [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) - exposing the ability to programmatically construct and manipulate generative functions, as well as [JIT compile + auto-batch inference computations using generative functions onto GPU devices](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/02-jitting.html).

## Development environment

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) to automate testing/linting/building, and [quarto](https://quarto.org/) to render Jupyter notebooks for tutorial documentation.

Make sure these are installed and on path with a Python environment `^3.10.0`. Running `nox` will evaluate the full test/linting/build/docs suite.

### Environment setup script

Here's a simple script to setup a compatible development environment - if you can run this script, you have a working development environment which can be used to execute the notebooks, etc.

```bash
conda create --name genjax-py311 python=3.11 --channel=conda-forge
conda activate genjax-py311
pip install poetry
pip install nox
pip install nox-poetry
git clone https://github.com/probcomp/genjax
cd genjax
poetry lock
poetry install
poetry run jupyter-lab
```
