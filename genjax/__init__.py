`genjax` is a probabilistic programming library built by combining the conceptual framework of [Gen](https://www.mct.dev/assets/mct-thesis.pdf) with the high-performance numerical compilation of [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). In several ways, these two systems are a natural pair - JAX provides flexibility to construct composable function transformations as interpreters, and Gen provides a rich set of modelling and inference ideas grounded in a functional representations of generative processes.

## High-level

- Generative functions (models) are represented as pure functions from `(PRNGKey, *args)` to `(PRNGKey, retval)`.
- Exposes [the generative function interface](https://www.gen.dev/stable/ref/gfi/) as staged effect handlers built on top of `jax`.

  | Interface     | Semantics (informal)                                                                |
  | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `simulate`    | Sample from normalized measure over choice maps                                     |
  | `importance`  | Importance sample from conditioned measure, and compute an importance weight        |
  | `arg_grad`    | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to arguments                |
  | `choice_grad` | Compute gradient of `logpdf` of choice map with respect to values of random choices |

- Supports usage of any computations acceptable by JAX (tbd) within generative function programs.
